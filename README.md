This repository contains the code used for the shared travel blog, http://www.wanderbydesign.co/

The site is integrated with WordPress.org and uses the Nisarg theme - see readme.txt in this repository for details.

Custom pages (built by us on top of the Nisarg theme) include the Home and About Us pages (http://www.wanderbydesign.co/about-us/). However, these styles are contained in the admin section of our WordPress isntance, and cannot be viewed here.

The code for the home page map, written in Javascript, can be [viewed within this repository](../js/mapBuilder.js).
